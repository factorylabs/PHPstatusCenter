A quick and dirty PHP app (with iPhone interface!) to write status messages to a JSON store, sends push notifications via Notifo, and can be read with a JSONP API.

This is a perfect internal tool for organizations that need to quickly update members with simple text messages, and then display those messages elsewhere.

Yup, it's "dirty". PHP writes directly to a .json file (make sure file perms are set correctly!), and very little security has been added so far. Be careful.
